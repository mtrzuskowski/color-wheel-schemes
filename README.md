## General Information
  It is a project that I undertook, while trying to deepen my knowledge of color theory and UI design. 
  It can be used by artists or developers to create harmonised, beatiful color compositions to use in their projects.


## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- React 18.0.2

## Features
- Creating palettes using color wheel and color schemes
- Generating palettes based on an image uploaded by the user

## Setup
Clone this repo to your desktop and run ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies.


## Usage
After you clone this repo to your desktop, go to its root directory and run ```npm install``` to install its dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run ```npm start``` to start the application. You will then be able to access it at localhost:3000


## Project Status
Project is put on hold.


## Room for Improvement
Currently generating color palettes based on image uploaded by users is implemented using the library node-vibrant.
In future I hope to implement my own algorithm for image analysis and pallete creation
